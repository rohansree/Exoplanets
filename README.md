# Study of Exoplanets: A Journey through Data & Space 🛰️🚀 
As part of the ECE 143 Fall 2023 final assignment, we have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Predictive Analysis on the [NASA Exoplanets Dataset](exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=PSCompPars).<br>

We have attached an additional [documentation](documentation.md) for all the modules which we have developed for the parsing, visualising and training predictive models.

### Disclaimer ⚠️
The notebook can't show all the graphs in default github viewer. You can view all the images properly in [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/rohansree/Exoplanets/blob/main/Exoplanets_Viz.ipynb)
<br>
<b>Recommended</b>: Setup locally to view the interactive plotly plots.
